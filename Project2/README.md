# Directory of Heroes
Using an online API which stores near 750 comic book characters (including Star Wars, Godzilla and some Japanese manga characters) we created a Superhero/Super Villain directory. A user can view characters by scrolling through a table or with search bar capability to look up a specific character by name. When the search is used, it’ll yield a response with three fields: character name, real name, and image. This prevents any confusion between characters with the same or similar names. Once characters are selected, the user is redirected to a Character Profile page which will contain information such as a biography, alliances, and statistics. The user has the option to add the character to a “Fantasy Team.” The user is also able to search up other teams (whether premade or user made) which yields clickable results containing the team name and the user who created them (in the case of premade teams, the creator will be Marvel/DC/Dark Horse/etc.).
